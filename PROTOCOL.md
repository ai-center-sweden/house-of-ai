# House of AI Protocol

> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Date:** 2025-01-21

***

**Preamble**

The House of AI is an international initiative aimed at fostering collaboration, knowledge sharing, and AI development across borders. This protocol serves as a foundational guideline for establishing, operating, and connecting Houses of AI in different countries. It provides a common framework while allowing for flexibility and adaptation to local contexts.

***

## I. Establishing a House of AI

*   **Initiation:** Any group of three or more individuals can initiate the formation of a House of AI in their country. 

    > Before establishing a new House of AI, initiators **must** check the public House of AI project database to ensure no other House of AI exists within their country. If one exists, they should join and contribute to the existing House of AI. 
*   **Membership:** Membership in a House of AI should be open to all individuals, organizations, and institutions within that country, regardless of their level of AI expertise or involvement. 

    >  All members should have the right to participate in elections for the governing body. The membership fee should be reasonable and designed to avoid creating a financial barrier to entry.
*   **Governance:** Each House of AI should establish a clear governance structure, including a leadership team or council responsible for overseeing its activities and representing its members in international interactions.
*   **Core Principles:**  All Houses of AI should adhere to the following core principles:
    *   **Openness and Inclusivity:** Encourage participation from diverse stakeholders across all sectors and communities.
    *   **Transparency and Accountability:** Maintain transparent operations and ensure accountability in decision-making processes.
    *   **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Actively engage in collaborative activities and knowledge exchange with other Houses of AI.

## II. Operating a House of AI

*   **Activities:** Each House of AI should engage in activities that promote international collaboration, knowledge sharing, and AI development. These may include:
    *   Organizing joint events and workshops with other Houses of AI.
    *   Participating in international research projects and initiatives.
    *   Contributing to the development of global AI guidelines and standards.
    *   Facilitating the exchange of information and best practices between countries.
*   **Communication:** Establish clear communication channels and protocols for interacting with other Houses of AI, such as:
    *   Designated contact persons or communication teams.
    *   Regular online meetings or forums for information sharing and discussion.
    *   Participation in international AI events and conferences.
*   **Reporting:**  Each House of AI should regularly report on its activities and progress:
    *   **National Report:** Publish a public report accessible to everyone within its country, providing updates on the House of AI's activities, initiatives, and contributions to the national AI landscape. This report may also include information relevant to the broader public, such as summaries of key AI developments, ethical considerations, and opportunities for engagement.
    *   **Optional Internal Reports:**  May produce additional internal reports for specific audiences, such as members, committees, or governing bodies, as needed.
    *   **International Report:**  Publish a public report accessible to the global community, providing insights into the country's AI landscape, key initiatives, challenges, and opportunities for international collaboration. This report serves as a valuable resource for other Houses of AI, international organizations, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the AI ecosystem within that country.
*   **Roles:** 
    > Each House of AI shall designate the following roles:
    *   **Chair:**  Leads the governing body and oversees internal operations.
    *   **Representative:**  Acts as the primary contact person for international communication and collaboration.
    *   **Mediator:**  Participates in dispute resolution processes as needed.
***

## III.  Connecting with Other Houses of AI

*   **Initial Contact:**  New Houses of AI are encouraged to introduce themselves to the existing network through designated communication channels.
*   **Registration:** 

    > Each House of AI **must** register its information in the public House of AI project database to ensure visibility and facilitate connections with other Houses.
*   **Collaboration:**  Houses of AI are encouraged to proactively seek collaboration opportunities with each other, such as:
    *   Joint research projects.
    *   Co-hosting events or workshops.
    *   Sharing resources and best practices.
    *   Contributing to joint publications or policy recommendations.

***

## IV. Dispute Resolution

*   **Mediator Committee:**  

    > In the event of disputes between two or more Houses of AI, a committee of mediators from uninvolved Houses will be formed to facilitate resolution.

***

## V.  Amendments and Evolution

*   **Flexibility:**  This protocol is intended to be a living document that can evolve and adapt as the "House of AI" network grows and matures.
*   **Amendments:**  Amendments to this protocol can be proposed by any House of AI and will be subject to approval by the Protocol Committee.

***

## VI.  Disclaimer

This protocol provides a general framework for the "House of AI" network. Each House of AI retains the autonomy to define its specific operational procedures, membership criteria, and activities, as long as they align with the core principles outlined in this document.
